# Department Management System
# Overview:
The Department Management System is a Java-based solution developed to enhance administrative processes within a university department. This project focused exclusively on the backend implementation, utilizing Java with Spring Data REST and H2 as the in-memory database. The backend system provides essential functionalities for managing student records, course schedules, faculty assignments, and resource allocation.

# Key Features:

<b>Student Management:</b> Robust backend for managing student data, including enrollment, registration, and academic progress tracking.<br>
<b>Course Scheduling:</b> Backend support for creating and managing course schedules, including class times, instructors, and room assignments.<br>
<b>Teacher Assignment:</b> Backend logic for assigning faculty members to courses, tracking availability, and teaching responsibilities.<br>
<b>Resource Allocation:</b> Backend handling of resource allocation, such as classrooms.
# Technologies Used:

<b>Java:</b> The project leveraged Java for its reliability and flexibility in developing the backend logic.<br>
<b>Spring Data REST:</b> Spring Data REST was employed to create a RESTful API, providing a standardized interface for future frontend development.<br>
<b>H2 Database:</b> H2 served as the in-memory database for efficient data storage and retrieval.<br>
<b>Git/GitHub:</b> Version control was managed using Git, with the code hosted on GitHub.
