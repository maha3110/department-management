# Department Management System
# Overview:
The Department Management System is a Java-based solution developed to enhance administrative processes within a university department. This project focused exclusively on the backend implementation, utilizing Java with Spring Data REST and H2 as the in-memory database. The backend system provides essential functionalities for managing student records, course schedules, faculty assignments, and resource allocation.

# Key Features:

Student Management: Robust backend for managing student data, including enrollment, registration, and academic progress tracking.
Course Scheduling: Backend support for creating and managing course schedules, including class times, instructors, and room assignments.
Teacher Assignment: Backend logic for assigning faculty members to courses, tracking availability, and teaching responsibilities.
Resource Allocation: Backend handling of resource allocation, such as classrooms.
# Technologies Used:

Java: The project leveraged Java for its reliability and flexibility in developing the backend logic.
Spring Data REST: Spring Data REST was employed to create a RESTful API, providing a standardized interface for future frontend development.
H2 Database: H2 served as the in-memory database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Git/GitHub: Version control was managed using Git, with the code hosted on GitHub.
